# TabCtrl - Google-Extension

TabCtrl is a Google Extension made to allow users to organize and reformat their windows and tabs without using the mouse or trackpad.

Before using, open the popup and adjust the window to the normal, maximum screen size. Then, press P to allow the extension to register what the normal screen size is, in order to calculate how to split the screen for other commands.

This uses HTML, CSS, JQuery, mousetrap.js from https://craig.is/killing/mice, as well as the Chrome API.
